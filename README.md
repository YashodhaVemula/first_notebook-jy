This project focuses on how to solve a an application of system of linear equation, that is finding out the current in a given branch or a volatge at the node in a given mesh.
Mesh analysis :  Mesh analysis is a method for analyzing circuits that involves identifying and solving for the voltages and currents in each "mesh" or loop of the circuit. 
                 It is based on Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), which states that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit must be equal to zero. 
                 By using this law, along with Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), a system of equations can be formed and solved to determine the unknown voltages 
                 and currents in a circuit.We can use any on the methods to solve these system of linear equations to either obtain current or volatge. 
                 Here only current passing through a particular mesh is calculated.
System of linear equations:A system of linear equations is a collection of one or more equations involving the same variables.A system of linear equations can be represented
                           in the form of matrix, which is called coefficient matrix, and a vector on the right hand side, which is called the constant vector. 
                           The matrix representation is called an augmented matrix.The system of linear equations can be solved using various methods like
                           substitution, elimination, graphing and also using matrix algebra like Gaussian elimination, Gauss-Jordan elimination, 
                           Cramer's rule, inverse matrix method and LU decomposition.
  The circuit diagram is given as below:
